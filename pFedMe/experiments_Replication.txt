* Instructions to run the experiments to generate the results obtained in Table 2 and Table 3 of the paper 'Unifying Distillation with Personalization in Federated Learning', for the methods 'pFedMe' and 'Per-FedAvg'.

* Run the following commands on the terminal:

(1) To generate the results for the pFedMe model on CIFAR-10
    nohup bash pFedMe_CIFAR-10.sh > pFedMe_CIFAR-10.out &
    
(2) To generate the results for the Per-FedAvg model on CIFAR-10
    nohup bash PerFed_CIFAR-10.sh > PerFed_CIFAR-10.out &
    
(3) To generate the results for the pFedMe model on MNIST
    nohup bash pFedMe_MNIST.sh > pFedMe_MNIST.out &
    
(4) To generate the results for the Per-FedAvg model on MNIST
    nohup bash PerFed_MNIST.sh > PerFed_MNIST.out &


* Once these experiments are done running, the results for these experiments will be stored in ./results/ folder.

* For an analysis of these results, please take a look at the Jupyter notebooks under the folder: './experiments_Replication/'.
